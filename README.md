#CIS-120
This game was created as part of the University of Pennsylvania's CIS 120 Programming Languages and Techniques class Final Project. The game is a traditional version of the Snake game and was implemented using the Java Swing library. The main class that runs the game is called Game.java. The high-scores.txt file is where we record and keep track of high scores throughout the game. There are image files for the apple and the snake parts. Enjoy!

You CANNOT use this code as part of a Homework assignment.
